The core lib basically does translation on the syllable level. It can handle strings with syllables nicely seperated by spaces. Successive layers should make it possible to convert a sentence with interpunction into a different system. It should be possible to write compound words together in Hanyu, and have the syllables seperated by dashes when converting to WG. For instance:

Wǒ de péngyǒu, shì dàifu.  =>  Wǒ te p`éng-yǔ, shih tài-fu.
